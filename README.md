# Zomato-Restaurant-Clustering-and-Sentiment-Analysis

Developed a clustering model to group restaurants based on their features such as cuisine, cost, location, and user ratings using techniques such as k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. Conducted sentiment analysis on user reviews using natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to extract valuable insights on customer satisfaction and identify areas of improvement. Utilized topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify the most discussed topics among customers.

### Key Findings:

Identifying the most popular topics among customers can help restaurants in designing their menus, improving services, and enhancing the overall customer experience.
Clustering similar restaurants can help users in making informed decisions on where to dine based on their preferences and budget
